## Get it

You can find the .app here:
[mediano.vercel.app](https://mediano.vercel.app)

This is a designer's first Swift app so it's probably really buggy, feel free to [report](https://github.com/nuance-dev/Medio/issues) any bugs found and I'll do my best to fix them.

## Fun facts?

- First version was made within a day by Claude Sonnet 3.5

- Medio was actually used to develop itself

## üöÄ How It Works

Medio splits your screen into two editing panes:
- **Left Pane**: Original text
- **Right Pane**: Modified text

As you type or paste text into either pane, Medio automatically:
1. Detects differences at both the line and word level
2. Highlights changes in real-time
3. Uses color coding to show:
   - üî¥ Deletions (in red)
   - üü¢ Additions (in green)
   - Changes are highlighted with corresponding background colors
